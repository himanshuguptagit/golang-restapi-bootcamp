Lesson 2 - Get Started with MVC and JSON
M -> Model -> A model or structure for data that is stored in DB. for example:  for user model can be:
    class User{
        int id
        string name;
        string emailId;
        string password;
    }

V -> View -> View is where we can see our data. for example: the frontend part of website which shows the user profile data when fetched from backend.

C -> Controller -> Controller act as an interface to transfer data from model (database) to view (frontend) and vice-versa.

Json -> is a kind of data format which is used to transfer data for http requests.

Tasks:
1. Create User model
2. Complete the functions in userController to perform CRUD operations on users.
3. Convert data to json to respond to http request.
4. Test the APIs on Postman

Hints:
1. Create User is done for reference.
